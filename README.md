# Principles of Computer Systems  
 

---

## **Project Overview**  
This project is divided into two parts:  

### **Part 1: Students Record Management Software**  
A system designed to manage student records efficiently using principles from system thinking and SDLC.  

#### **Deliverables**  
1. **Software Requirement Specification (SRS):**  
   - End-user version  
   - Developer version  
     

2. **Project Planning:**  
   - Planner and roles assigned.  
   - Timeline with Gantt charts.  

3. **Knowledge Application:**  
   - Application of SDLC and system thinking for defining deliverables.

### **Part 2: Numerical Methods and Optimization**  
Development of programs to compute derivatives and optimize them.  

#### **Deliverables**  
1. **Raw Code:**  
   - Calculate \( f'(x) \) and \( f''(x) \) for \( f(x) = x*exp(x) in the range \( x = 1.5 \) to \( x = 2.5 \) using:  
     - Eulerâ€™s Method  
     - Runge-Kutta Method  

2. **Memory and Cache Analysis:**  
   - Analyze memory usage and cache behavior using tools like `tracemalloc` and `cProfile`.  

3. **Optimized Code:**  
   - Enhanced performance using optimization techniques.
